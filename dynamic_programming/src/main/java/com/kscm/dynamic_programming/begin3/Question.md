## Question
Write a function `canSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a targetsum and an array of numbers as arguments.

The function should return a boolean indicating wheather or not it is possible to generate the targetSum using numbers from the array.

You may use an element of the array as many times as you needed.

You may assume that all elements are non negative

Ex1: 
```text
canSum(7, [5, 3, 4, 7])
Answer: true --> [3, 4] and [7]
```

Ex2:
```text
canSum(7, [2, 4])
Answer: --> false
```
