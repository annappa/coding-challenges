Find all words matching a pattern in the given dictionary

Given a dictionary of words where each word follows a CamelCase notation, find all words in it that matches a given pattern of all uppercase characters.

CamelCase Notation is the practice of writing compound words or phrases joined without spaces, where each wordâ€™s first letter is capitalized.
For example, PowerPoint, LibreOffice, CinemaScope, etc., are in CamelCase.

For example, consider the dictionary.

dict = [Hi, HiTech, HiTechCity, Hello, HelloWorld, HiTechLab]

- If the pattern is HT, the output is [HiTech, HiTechCity, HiTechLab].
- If the pattern is HTC, the output is [HiTechCity].
- If the pattern is H, the output is the same as the input.

 Solution: We can use a Trie datastructure to solve this problem. The idea is to insert all uppercase characters of each word in the CamelCase dictionary into a Trie. In contrast, the complete word is stored in a container associated with the corresponding leaf node. After the complete dictionary is processed, traverse the Trie and find all words that match the given pattern.
