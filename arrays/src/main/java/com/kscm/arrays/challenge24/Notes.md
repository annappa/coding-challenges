## Question
Given a list of distinct unsorted integers, find the pair of elements that have the smallest absolute difference between them? If there are multiple pairs, find them all.

Examples:
```text
Input : arr[] = {10, 50, 12, 100}
Output : (10, 12)
The closest elements are 10 and 12

Input : arr[] = {5, 4, 3, 2}
Output : (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)
```
